# Mint-X-Dark

This is my own attempt of creating a perfect dark theme of Mint-X. The Linux Mint already created a dark theme for Mint-X but it's only usable for selected apps. This theme uses that color scheme and applys it across the entire system. GTK3 support is 100% done. GTK2 is still using the original white theme, since i haven't done the bitmaps yet. I don't care about libadwaita, since i use MATE, so i'll never touch these folders.
