# Mint-X Dark Theme

![the beloved Mint-X now in proper dark-mode!](ScreenshotNEW.png)

This is my attempt at creating a complete dark theme for Mint-X. Linux Mint provides a dark variant of Mint-X, but it is only applied to selected applications. This theme extends that color scheme across the entire system.  

I also included a modified Mint-X icon theme, that has been adapted to work nicely with dark themes.

- **GTK3**: Fully supported  
- **GTK2**: Basic GTK2 support implemented. Still many bitmaps to go.
- **Libadwaita**: Not supported, since I use MATE and will not modify these folders  

The goal is a consistent dark experience across all GTK applications while retaining compatibility with MATE.
